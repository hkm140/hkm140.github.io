This code creates a simple website with a heading, a SVG animation, and a centered H2 element. The SVG animation is created using the svg element and the path element. The path element is used to create the different shapes that make up the animation. The svg element also contains the viewBox attribute, which specifies the dimensions of the SVG viewport.

The .svg-frame CSS class is used to style the SVG animation. The .vertical-center CSS class is used to center the H2 element

can you improvise it?

Sure, here are some suggestions for improving the index.html file:

Use more descriptive element IDs and CSS class names. For example, instead of #inner1, you could use #inner-shape-1. This will make your code more readable and maintainable.
Use CSS variables to centralize common values. For example, you could create a CSS variable for the SVG width and height, and then use that variable throughout your code. This will make it easier to update the size of the SVG if needed.
Use CSS mixins to reduce code repetition. For example, you could create a CSS mixin for the stroke and fill properties, and then use that mixin on all of the SVG paths. This will make your code more concise and reusable.
Use HTML5 semantic elements. For example, instead of using a <div> element for the SVG animation, you could use a <figure> element. This will make your code more semantic and accessible.
Here is an example of how you could implement these suggestions:
